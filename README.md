#  Module 3 python-challenge

1. Created a new repository for this project called python challenge and coned it to the computer.
2. In the local git repository, created new folders / directory for each challenge - Used folder names - PyBank and  PyPoll
3. Inside each folder - 
  a- Created the 'Resources' folder and added the CSV files, 
  b- Added a new file called `main.py` to be the python script to run each analysis, and 
  c- Created 'analysis' folder that will contain the results text file 

PyBank Challenge - 
Tasked with creating a python script to analyze the financial records using the budget_data.csv file.  The python script analyzed the records to calculate - 
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The script printed the analysis to the terminal and also exported a text file with the results to the 'analysis' folder.

PyPoll Challenge - 
Tasked with creating a python script to analyze the vote count of a small rural town using election_data.csv. We had to create a Python script to calculate -
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Here also the script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results to the 'analysis' folder.
